## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
Define what Generative AI means.

Identify its basic principle → next-token prediction.

Highlight difference vs. discriminative AI.

Explain data, training, and generative process.

## Output
Generative AI refers to models that learn patterns from large datasets and create new content such as text, images, or audio. Unlike discriminative AI (which classifies data), generative AI produces original sequences by predicting the next likely element (e.g., word). The foundation lies in probability modeling, self-supervised learning, and large-scale pretraining.

## Result
Understanding: Generative AI = creation rather than classification.

Key principle: “Predict next token → generate meaningful sequence.”
